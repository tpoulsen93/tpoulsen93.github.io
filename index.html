<h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
<hr>


<p>Way back in the ancient times, before cloud computing was a thing, business IT
solutions typically included rooms full of physical servers with one or more
"System Administrators" working to manage them. These servers had to be
manually configured with their hardware and software resources according to
their job, whether they be managing the database system or the computing
power or the development environments or any other myriad systems a
business might need. These systems were typically all or nothing. As soon as
resources for one machine aren't enough, the system administrator would have to
set up an entire new machine and then that machine would only be using a small
amount of its resources until the demand grew enough for the whole new machine
to be worth it. These systems were also prone to be unreliable. If a server
went down, the businesses server would go down until the server was fixed or
replaced. Some companies might have enough resources to add some redundancy to
the system in times like these, but not always. These are just a sample of a few
of the problems and weaknesses of the way computing used to work. Luckily for
us, we can now take advantage of the cloud!</p>

  <p>As of 2021, the cloud computing market was worth about $250 billion dollars. It
has been growing at a rapid pace and is expected to continue growing. The
reasons for the popularity of the cloud are pretty clear, and pretty awesome...
Remember the problems we were talking about earlier? Well cloud computing
solves quite a few of them. Microsofts Azure described the cloud, much more
beautifully than I can, on their website... </p>

  <p>"Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including
servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and
intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation,
flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud
services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your
infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change."</p>

 <p>Using the cloud means companies no longer have to have a team of administrators
to manager their servers. They no longer have to pay for computing resources
that they aren't using during downtime, or worry about running out of computing
power or storage during high traffic times. They no longer need to be worried
about their systems going down or their data getting lost... They actually
probably are still worried about these things, but less so than before :) In
short, the cloud provides a lot of convenience in ensuring redundancy,
availability, and scalability for software systems.</p>

 <p>I would now like to hone in on one of the specific aspects of cloud computing
that I learned about recently and found to be really amazing... Message Queues.
Amazons AWS described Message Queues like this:</p>

<p>"A message queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication
  used in serverless and microservices architectures. Messages are stored on
  the queue until they are processed and deleted. Each message is processed
  only once, by a single consumer. Message queues can be used to decouple
  heavyweight processing, to buffer or batch work, and to smooth spiky
workloads."</p>
<h5> - https://aws.amazon.com/message-queue/</h5>

 <p>Message queue's allow for one of the best parts about cloud computing:
Modularization. Breaking a big system down into a bunch of smaller systems,
that split the work apart into chunks, makes the system as a whole much easier
to "develop, deploy, and maintain". This distribution of the work can lead to
improved "performance, reliability, and scalability". They accomplish all of
this by acting as a kind of middle man between different applications.</p>

 <p>A common pattern with online applications can be broken down into 4 separate
sections. Ingest, Persist, Process, Serve. Each of these sections could be
separated by a message queue.</p>

 <p>The "Ingest" section could be described as the part that is outward facing to
users. User interactions with the front facing system would be pushed onto a
message queue where they would wait until the next system is ready to grab
them.</p>

 <p>The next system is the part that handles "Persistance". This system would be
grabbing messages off the message queue as fast as it wanted and storing them
in a more permanent way, such as a database or file system. This part is
essential not only for future use of the data, if necessary, but also for
additional redundancy. Message queues aren't meant to be a long term storage
solution.</p>

 <p>The next system in the line is "Processing". Processing, is grabbing the data and
doing some kind of work on it. Whether that be doing math with it, or changing
it, or adorning it, or whatever it may be. The processing and the persistance
of the data can be interchangeable in order. Sometimes you may want to do the
processing before the storage or even do the storage before and after the
processing. In which case a message queue probably isn't the right tool for a
middle man, but it definitely is for between the ingestion of the data and
whatever step comes next.</p>

 <p>The last step in the pattern is "Service". This is the part that includes
sending the data back from the depths of the computational dungeons up to the
front where it can be viewed and/or consumed by users. This part may or may not
need a message queue to handle the transfer of data. If we're talking about
some kind of a live system that is constantly updating, a message queue would
probably be a good solution. However, if the data needed to be completely
aggregated before it could be consumed, a message queue probably wouldn't be
the best option.</p>

 <p>The moral of the story is that cloud computing, and it's message queues, allow
big systems to be broken down and modularized in such a way that the individual
pieces can work independently of each other. This independence can be
beautifully combined with our final topic. Scalability.</p>

 <p>Scalability in the cloud is amazing. The cloud systems allow for businesses to
dynamically change the amount of computational resources they are paying for as
they are using them. Each individual part of the system can be spun up into
more instances to handle more work during heavy load times or less instances
during light load. Disk space and availability can shrink and grow as they need
to over time. Thereby allowing the business to only pay for what they need at
the time instead of having extra resources at all times that are wasting
money, energy, and space.</p>

 <p>Obviously, the cloud isn't a magical thing that is actually in the clouds or
managed by fairies. There are still system administrators and technicians that
are working on machines to keep them alive. The only difference is that these
personnel are out of sight and out of mind for the businesses that are using
these cloud services. As far as we know, the cloud might as well be in the
clouds and managed by fairies. That's what makes cloud computing seem so
magical.</p>
